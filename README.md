# react-select-demo

Demo application made to learn about using react-select
(More specifically, multi/creatables with Typescript.)

Given limited documentation for react-select and MSW v2+ with Typescript, it became an experiment to work out how react-select / msw types work.
Excessively commented so that I can use this as a reference!
